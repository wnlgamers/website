## About Us

WNL Gamers is a welcoming board game club in Wootton, Bedford. Our evenings are filled with laughter, games, and a relaxed sense of community. Whether you're a first-time gamer or a seasoned strategist, there's always a seat at the table for you.

We usually meet on the second Saturday of each month at [**Wootton New Life Methodist Church**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/3PZ1GrVyryVJnVL29). The evening begins at **6:00 PM**, with food, snacks, and drinks available as people arrive. Everything is free to enjoy, but we suggest a **£3 donation** per person to help cover costs — and we also offer **cans of drink for £1 each**. There's no pressure to contribute; just come along and enjoy yourself.

The event space is set up café-style, with games on display and plenty of opportunity to browse, chat, or settle in. Around **6:15–6:20 PM**, the evening kicks off with a short welcome from our organiser, who explains how things will run.

We usually start with a **short “filler” game** — something light and quick to get things going. Our regular **table hosts** each introduce the game (or games) they'll be running, and guests are invited to join whichever table appeals.

After the first round (around **40 minutes**), there's a short break before we move on to **longer, more strategic games**. Again, table hosts introduce their picks, and guests can move around and choose where they’d like to play. We typically wrap up around **9:00 PM**.

We're a relatively new group, currently with **4 regular table hosts**, a few faithful helpers, and a mix of newcomers and returning guests. We're growing slowly and hope to become a fixture of the local community.

While we're not a religious group, WNL Gamers is proudly supported by [**Wootton New Life Methodist Church**](https://www.woottonnewlife.com/), who host us and see the club as a fun way to bring the community together and welcome new faces into the building.

We’re also hoping to try out new ideas — like a **swap-and-sell table**, or lending games between members — so don’t be surprised if the format shifts now and then!

Come along, bring a friend, and see what it’s all about.

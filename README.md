# WNL Gamers Website

A community-driven website for the Wootton board game group, built using Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. This site displays curated information on board games (including an embedded Geeklist) and serves as a hub for event details and resources for both new and returning members.

## Features

- **Dynamic Geeklist Integration:** Displays games from a Geeklist with thumbnails, descriptions, and links to BoardGameGeek.
- **Responsive, Themed Design:** Utilizes a remote Jekyll theme with custom CSS overrides.
- **Universal Navigation:** Consistent navigation across the site with active state highlighting.
- **Community Focus:** Designed to be easy to update and contribute to by board game enthusiasts.

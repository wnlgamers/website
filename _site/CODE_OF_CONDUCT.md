# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a respectful, inclusive, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Showing empathy toward others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders at [info@wnlgamers.uk](mailto:info@wnlgamers.uk). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.

Community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

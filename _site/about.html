<p>WNL Gamers is a welcoming board game club in Wootton, Bedford. Our evenings are filled with laughter, games, and a relaxed sense of community. Whether you’re a first-time gamer or a seasoned strategist, there’s always a seat at the table for you.</p>

<p>We usually meet on the second Saturday of each month at <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/3PZ1GrVyryVJnVL29"><strong>Wootton New Life Methodist Church</strong></a>. The evening begins at <strong>6:00 PM</strong>, with food, snacks, and drinks available as people arrive. Everything is free to enjoy, but we suggest a <strong>£3 donation</strong> per person to help cover costs — and we also offer <strong>cans of drink for £1 each</strong>. There’s no pressure to contribute; just come along and enjoy yourself.</p>

<p>The event space is set up café-style, with games on display and plenty of opportunity to browse, chat, or settle in. Around <strong>6:15–6:20 PM</strong>, the evening kicks off with a short welcome from our organiser, who explains how things will run.</p>

<p>We usually start with a <strong>short “filler” game</strong> — something light and quick to get things going. Our regular <strong>table hosts</strong> each introduce the game (or games) they’ll be running, and guests are invited to join whichever table appeals.</p>

<p>After the first round (around <strong>40 minutes</strong>), there’s a short break before we move on to <strong>longer, more strategic games</strong>. Again, table hosts introduce their picks, and guests can move around and choose where they’d like to play. We typically wrap up around <strong>9:00 PM</strong>.</p>

<p>We’re a relatively new group, currently with <strong>4 regular table hosts</strong>, a few faithful helpers, and a mix of newcomers and returning guests. We’re growing slowly and hope to become a fixture of the local community.</p>

<p>While we’re not a religious group, WNL Gamers is proudly supported by <a href="https://www.woottonnewlife.com/"><strong>Wootton New Life Methodist Church</strong></a>, who host us and see the club as a fun way to bring the community together and welcome new faces into the building.</p>

<p>We’re also hoping to try out new ideas — like a <strong>swap-and-sell table</strong>, or lending games between members — so don’t be surprised if the format shifts now and then!</p>

<p>Come along, bring a friend, and see what it’s all about.</p>
